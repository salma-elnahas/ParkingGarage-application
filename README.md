# Parking Garage Application
This Parking Garage Management System is built using object-oriented programming and follows SOLID principles with a Boundary-Control-Entity (BCE) design.
It allows vehicles to park in and out, calculates parking fees based on time, displays available parking slots, and handles errors clearly. 
The system supports two parking methods: First Come First Served and Best Fit slot selection.
The project is developed using Java.
